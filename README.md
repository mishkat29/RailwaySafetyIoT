# Railway_Safety_IoT
This is an IoT report on the topic Railway Crossing Safety using IoT.
The proposed solution is divided into two parts one for the railway crossing
and the other for obstacle detection system. The circuit diagaram might not have some 
of the components due to lack of availabilty on Tinkercard. Similarly the proposed source code
might also lack libraries and function for advance solutions proposed due to 
lack of availability.

This is a theoretical approach.
